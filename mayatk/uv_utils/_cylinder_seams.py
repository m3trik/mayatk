"""Band-based UV seam placement for cylinder / tube / turned meshes.

Reached through :meth:`mayatk.UvUtils.get_auto_seam_edges` (and from there
``cut_cylinder_seams`` / ``unwrap_cylinder``). The core works on plain arrays
and imports nothing from Maya -- :meth:`_CylinderSeamsInternal.from_mesh` is
the one Maya-facing door -- so the same code is exercised offline against
hand-seamed reference meshes.

The seams reproduce what a texture artist does by hand on a turned or swept
part -- *clean and minimal*:

- The mesh is read as **rings** (edge chains that run around the tube) and
  the quad **bands** between consecutive rings. Non-quad faces (n-gon caps,
  triangle fans) form **cap** regions.
- Every band is classified by how its lengthwise edges sit against the
  band's own axis (the line through its two ring centres, so a bent or
  mitered tube is read locally): a **wall** runs along the axis (a
  cylinder, a slight taper); a **cone** is tilted further (a chamfer, a
  flare, a funnel) but still develops exactly as a sector; a **flat** band
  is near-perpendicular (a washer, a step) or leads into a cap (a dome) and
  lays out as a closed annulus / disc. Walls and cones are *strips*; a
  *trim* band (a fillet or bevel a few percent of the radius tall) joins the
  wall it rounds off, so a rounded collar rides its strip and a bead ring
  stays a ring.
- Every strip run is opened with **one** lengthwise cut, taken from a single
  edge chain (a *column*) that is followed through the whole tube, so every
  strip's seam lines up (a straight column on a turned part; the loop that
  follows the surface on a bent hose). Flat bands never get a lengthwise
  cut: an annulus / disc unfolds as-is. A run with no open end at all (a
  torus) also gets one crossing ring so it can unroll.
- A ring is cut where a strip meets a flat band (a step rim, a cap rim) --
  regardless of how shallow the angle -- and between two strips wherever the
  profile turns more than the taper tolerance (a chamfer never merges into
  its cylinders, a bent hose stays one strip); two flat bands only split at
  a fold-back (a countersink meeting a step), so a chamfer running into a
  step, or a domed cap with its fillet, stays one annulus / disc. An
  authored hard ring is a seam whatever the angle. ``angle`` is the crease
  threshold for geometry the tube reading doesn't cover, and -- set below
  the taper tolerance -- splits strips at gentler kinks.
- The column is chosen to hide the seam: the column facing away from the
  viewer (``camera`` -- Maya's default perspective direction when none is
  given, so the pick is deterministic) is used; ``invert_seam`` takes the
  opposite side.

3D boundary edges (an open tube's rims) are already UV borders and are never
cut. Faces that don't fit the band structure (a non-tube appendage, a
region where the quad grid breaks down) fall back to plain crease cuts.

After :meth:`seams`, :meth:`seed_uvs` hands out the developed shape of every
shell (strips unrolled from their seam, rings and discs unrolled radially) --
the seed ``unwrap_cylinder`` gives Unfold3D so it has nothing to untangle.

#: column, whose sector is its exact development (a 45 degree flare left as a

"""CSV mapping resolver — interprets JSON mapping files.

A mapping file is a ``.json`` file that declaratively specifies how CSV columns
map to :class:`BuilderStep` fields and how derived values (e.g. audio objects)
are resolved. See :mod:`._mapping` for the file format and the full docstring.

Package facade: the implementation lives in :mod:`._mapping` (kept out of
``__init__`` per the package convention). The public API (below) is re-exported
here so ``from ...mapping import X`` and a ``...mapping.X`` mock patch keep
working. Private helpers (the ``_audio_*`` / ``_build_*`` builders) are not
re-exported — import or patch them at ``...mapping._mapping.<name>``.

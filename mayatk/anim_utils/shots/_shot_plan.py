"""Pure planning layer for multi-shot topology transformations.

NO MAYA IMPORTS — this module is part of the shot *model* layer and
must not import ``maya.cmds``.  It computes WHAT should
move WHERE given a :class:`ShotStore`, producing a :class:`MovePlan`
dataclass with no side effects.  Anything that actually writes to the
Maya scene lives in the sibling module :mod:`_shot_apply`.

Two-stage discipline for every multi-shot operation:
    1. Build a :class:`MovePlan` from the current :class:`ShotStore`.
    2. Hand the plan to :func:`_shot_apply.apply`.

The split exists because interleaved resolve → mutate loops (the old
``respace`` / ``_ripple_*`` shape) corrupted keyframes when a shot's
new envelope overlapped an unmoved neighbor's old envelope.  Keeping
planning pure makes that bug unwritable here.

Location rationale: this module sits beside :mod:`_shots` at the shot
package root because the plan is a *model-layer* description of how
shots transform — independent of any committer.  Future consumers
beyond the sequencer (dry-run preview, undo description, manifest
bulk reshape) can use it without reaching into ``shot_sequencer/``.

The core shots layer is therefore complete on its own: :mod:`_shots`
models the topology, :mod:`_shot_plan` resolves transformations, and
:mod:`_shot_apply` commits them.

"""Procedural draped-cloth (curtain) drape engine — pure geometry, no DCC.

A curtain hangs from a *rail* — any polyline in world space (see
:class:`ptk.Polyline`). The cloth is pinned to the rail at evenly-spaced
**hanging points**; each hanging point is a pleat (the fabric gathers there),
and between consecutive points the fabric bellies into a fold and its top edge
sags under gravity along a real **catenary** (``y = a·cosh(x/a)``).

:class:`CurtainDrape` is one *displacement field* over the general
:class:`ptk.RailSurface` primitive: the rail → frames → grid machinery is the
primitive's, while this class owns everything curtain-specific — the
pleat/fold/catenary/crease math (:meth:`drape`) and the seeded feature
precompute. A different curve-driven surface (banner, ribbon, terrain strip)
is a *different displacement over the same primitive*, not a fork of this
code. :meth:`CurtainDrape.grid_points` yields the full draped grid.

**Vendored twin — keep code-identical.** This file is duplicated in
``mayatk.edit_utils._curtain_drape`` and ``blendertk.edit_utils._curtain_drape``
(the two DCC consumers cannot import each other, and pythontk keeps only the
general primitives it composes — ``RailSurface``/``Polyline``/``MathUtils``/
``BandLimitedNoise`` — not this curtain-specific remainder). Mirror any change
into both copies; drift fails ``extapps/test/test_vendor_sync.py``.

class CurtainDrape:
    """Drape a grid into a pleated, gravity-sagged curtain — pure math.

    Consumes plain rail points (see :class:`ptk.Polyline`) and emits draped
    vertex positions; building the mesh from them is the DCC adapter's job. See
    ``mayatk.edit_utils.curtain.CurtainMesh`` for the parameter reference (the
    adapters re-expose this signature unchanged).

    Parameters:
        rail: Ordered world-space points the cloth hangs from (the rail).
        height: Drop of the curtain below the rail.
        hanging_points: Number of evenly-spaced pins (pleats) along the rail.
        hang_jitter: ``0``–``1`` — randomize the hang-point *spacing*.
        hang_seed: RNG seed for the random hang-point spacing.
        gravity: Catenary sag depth between hanging points (span-width scaled).
        tension: Catenary shape parameter (see :meth:`MathUtils.catenary`).
        round_points: ``0``–``1`` — round each hang-point cusp into a dome.
        round_gather: ``≥0`` — push-pull gather at each hanging point.
        fullness: Drapery fullness ratio (≥1); drives fold/belly depth.
        taper: ``-1``–``1`` vertical bias of the fold depth.
        mid_folds: Intensity of V-folds forking down from the hang points.
        mid_fold_seed: RNG seed for the mid-fold selection/shape.
        creases: Intensity of extra V-creases radiating from the top.
        crease_seed: RNG seed for the crease placement/length/depth.
        sway: Lateral fold lean along the rail (random subset of folds).
        sway_seed: RNG seed for which folds sway and how far/which way.
        end_bend_left: Signed sideways bend of the left end.
        end_bend_right: Signed sideways bend of the right end.
        end_bend_falloff: ``0``–``1`` — bend ramp-in fraction of the width.
        irregularity: Coherent band-limited surface grain (subtle).
        density: Mesh resolution in segments per world unit.
        closed: Treat the rail as a closed loop.
        name: Base name for the created object (used by the adapters).

    The Maya-side post-ops (``reduce`` / ``thickness`` / ``invert`` /
    ``soften``) are mesh operations, not drape math — the adapters own them but
    the parameters are accepted (and stored) here so a single ``**options``
    dict drives any adapter.

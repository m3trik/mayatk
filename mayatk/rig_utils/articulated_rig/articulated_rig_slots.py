"""Articulated Rig panel -- the Switchboard slots for ``articulated_rig.ui``.

A thin driver over :class:`ArticulatedRig`, in three groups:

- **Setup**: analyze the selection into a plan (the joints table), correct a
  joint's type, limits or give in the table, build -- with or without the end
  control;
- **Pose**: the viewport grab, switching the end control's IK on and off
  without a jump, and the rest pose;
- **Edit**: split a link off with a new joint, fold one back, limits from the
  pose, adjust the pivots (a handle per joint and on the end control; the
  rig rebuilds on them when the box is cleared), rebuild, remove.

The table shows the plan before a build and the rig after one; an edit made
there changes the plan, or the built rig in place (a type change rebuilds it
with its animation carried across). Clicking a row selects that joint's
control (before the build, its part).

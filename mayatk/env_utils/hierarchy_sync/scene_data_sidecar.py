"""Scene-data sidecar manifest management.

An export ships with ONE sidecar — ``.{stem}.scene_data.json`` — an
externalized copy of what shipped in the FBX: the exported hierarchy (which
the FBX carries natively as its node tree) and the ``data_export`` carrier
channels (which ride into the FBX as user properties).  Consumers get the
export's metadata without parsing FBX — and for GLB-only deliverables the
sidecar is the one guaranteed-readable copy.

Format v3::

    {
      "format": 3,
      "hierarchy": {
        "paths": [...], "object_count": N, "hash": "...",
        "last_diff": {"missing": [...], "extra": [...], "reparented": [...]}
      },
      "data_export": {"shot_metadata": {...}, "fbx_takes": [...], ...}
    }

- ``hierarchy`` — change-detection baseline: sorted namespace-stripped DAG
  paths from the last successful export (closed under ancestors — the parent
  chain ships with every exported node, see :meth:`SceneDataSidecar.with_ancestors`)
  plus a SHA-256 hash.  Subsequent
  exports compare against it to detect accidental structural changes
  (missing/extra nodes, reparenting).  :meth:`SceneDataSidecar.compare`
  reads ONLY ``paths``/``hash``, and the hash covers only the paths — so
  neither metadata churn nor a recorded ``last_diff`` can false-positive
  the hierarchy check.  ``last_diff`` appears only when the hierarchy check
  flagged a structural change on the export that wrote this manifest (i.e.
  the user saw the diff and proceeded): it records that accepted diff, and
  the next clean export drops it.  The human-readable report of the same
  diff is written to the system temp dir (see the exporter task), never to
  the export folder.
- ``data_export`` — snapshot of the ``data_export`` carrier at export time
  (``DataNodes.dump``), decoded to nested JSON.  Never includes
  ``data_internal``: that node's contract is scene-private state that must
  not export, and a sidecar next to the deliverable is a form of export.
  Omitted entirely when the carrier shipped nothing.

One file per stem is the contract (2026-08): the previous trio (manifest +
``.prev`` backup + ``.hierarchy_diff.txt`` report) cluttered shared
delivery folders, and a stale ``.prev`` reads as a deliverable — same
schema, same stem, older numbers, nothing marking it superseded.  The
``.prev`` rotation was crash insurance for a write ordering that moved the
live manifest aside before landing its replacement; the v3 write never
displaces the live manifest (tmp + atomic replace only), so that failure
window is gone, and a baseline that is lost anyway (deleted/corrupted
manifest) is surfaced by the exporter's check as a warning instead of
silently patched from a shadow copy.  Every successful write sweeps the
superseded companion files, so delivery folders self-clean as assets
re-export.  On Windows the manifest additionally gets
``FILE_ATTRIBUTE_HIDDEN`` (the dot-prefix convention hides nothing there);
``os.replace`` hands the result the tmp file's attributes, so the flag is
re-applied after every write.

Legacy content still reads: format v1 (a flat
``{"paths": ..., "object_count": ..., "hash": ...}`` under the name
``.{stem}.hierarchy.json``) and v2 (nested sections with external
companions) load through the same accessors, an existing ``.prev`` still
serves as a read fallback until it is swept, and :meth:`migrate_legacy`
promotes old-named files to the current name.

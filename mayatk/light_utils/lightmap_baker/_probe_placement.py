"""Where a lightmap bake's reflection probe stands, and the room it projects onto.

The geometry half of :meth:`LightmapBaker.bake_probe`, on its own because it
is the half that has to hold in every scene a generic baker meets -- a
furnished room, a hall, a courtyard, a car on a ground plane, a machine in a
warehouse. The first rule (the middle of what is baked, at half the room's
height, inside the room its rays found) held in the one room it was measured
in and put a probe where it could not see the room in each of the others:

* **Inside something.** The middle of what is baked is the room's middle in a
  room, and inside whatever stands there anywhere else -- the car on its
  ground plane, the statue, the column. A probe there renders the inside of a
  shell: black, lent to every reflection in the scene.
* **Against something.** A surface a few centimetres from the camera fills
  half the panorama, and every reflection the probe lends shows it.
* **Too high.** Half a room's height is eye level in a room and five metres up
  in a hall; with no ceiling (outdoors) it was half the tallest building's.
* **All or nothing.** One open side (a courtyard, a ground with no walls)
  read the whole room as open, so its walls and floor reflected as if
  infinitely far.

So the probe is placed in steps that each guard one of those, all measured by
ray casts against what the probe's render sees (:class:`_Rays`) -- the visible
baked meshes, and the unbaked ones that surround the bake (a sky dome, a
ground nobody baked); what moves is see-through to the render and to the rays:

1. **Open air** near the middle of the bake (:meth:`ProbePlacement._settle`):
   a point that sees the inside of a shell from every side, with no light in
   view, is in a solid, and is moved out by the shortest way.
2. **The room** around it (:meth:`ProbePlacement.faces`), face by face: an open
   face is open on its own, and the rest still project.
3. **Over what matters**: what moves in the room, else the room's middle,
   else -- an open scene -- the baked objects that are not its ground.
4. **At eye level**: half the room's height, at most
   :attr:`ProbePlacement.MAX_HEIGHT_M` above its floor.
5. **Clear of every surface** by :attr:`ProbePlacement.CLEARANCE_M`.

Everything inside is in Maya's internal unit (centimetres) whatever the
scene's; positions cross the boundary in scene units.
